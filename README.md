Orbis the first general-purpose layer 2 zero-knowledge (zk)
rollup protocol for the Cardano blockchain. With the use of cryptography
through the zero-knowledge proof encryption scheme, it proves a set of transactions
computed off-chain and verified on-chain, and with the prover node and verifier contract
architecture, it leverages this scheme to enable a permissionless system with strong
security guarantees that is isomorphic to the underlying Cardano mainchain.
Orbis' functional programming model enables secure decentralized application development on Orbis at scale
which aids in writing bug-free smart contracts. Orbis will
introduce a new paradigm to blockchain scalability through a distributed prover
node network utilizing recursive zk-SNARKs, which can scale with
$O(\log(n+m))$ time complexity to prove the validity of a block of
$n$ transactions containing $m$ smart contract invocations.
