# The Orbis Project

The Orbis Project is an effort, led by [Ardana](https://ardana.org/), to create a ZK rollups layer 2 solution for Cardano. This project aims to address scalability challenges on Cardano, particularly to support decentralized finance (DeFi) applications such as those which Ardana has promised to deliver. In order to compete with the world of centralized finance, these applications must support massive transaction throughput, on the order of thousands of transactions per second. The Orbis Project aims to deliver this level of transaction throughput, and ultimately any desired level of transaction throughput, for decentralized applications (dapps) built on Cardano. The goal is to deliver for Cardano something comparable to ZK rollups solutions for Ethereum, like [zkSync](https://zksync.io/), [StarkNet](https://starkware.co/starknet/), and [Loopring](https://loopring.org/#/).
