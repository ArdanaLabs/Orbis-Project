Orbis is an effort led by Orbis Labs to create a ZK rollups layer 2 solution for Cardano. It aims to address scalability challenges on Cardano, particularly to support decentralized finance (DeFi) applications. In order to compete with the world of centralized finance, these applications must support massive transaction throughput, on the order of thousands of transactions per second. Orbis aims to deliver this level of transaction throughput, and ultimately any desired level of transaction throughput, for decentralized applications (dapps) built on Cardano.
